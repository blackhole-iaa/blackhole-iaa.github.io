Our research group is focused on the study of black hole accretion and relativistic jet formation through very long baseline interferometric  (VLBI) observations with mm-wave arrays, such as the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), and orbiting antennas, such as the space VLBI mission RadioAstron. In particular our research group is playing a key role in the scientific exploitation of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

<p align="justify">
Our group is part of the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía (IAA-CSIC), in Granada, Spain, currently an EHT affiliated institution, one of the most important investigation centers of the country also distinguished with the “Severo Ochoa Center of Excellence Award”.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Our research group has become one of the most relevant in the EHT, and is playing a key role in the analysis of the EHT observations of SgrA*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, for which the entire scientific community  has big expectations and whose results will be published soon.

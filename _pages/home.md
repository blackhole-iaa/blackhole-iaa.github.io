Our research group is focused on the study of black hole accretion and relativistic jet formation through very long baseline interferometric observations (VLBI) with mm-wave arrays, such as the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), orbiting antennas, such as the space VLBI mission RadioAstron, and long-term monitoring programs such as MOJAVE and VLBA-BU-BLAZAR. (see [Research](research)).

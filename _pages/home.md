Our research group at IAA is focused on the study of black hole accretion and relativistic jet formation through very long baseline interferometric observations (VLBI) with mm-wave arrays, such as the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), and orbiting antennas, such as the space VLBI mission RadioAstron. In particular our research group is playing a key role in the scientific exploitation of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

Dr. Gómez, the group leader, is a member of the EHT Science Council and one of the three coordinators of the EHT Imaging Working Group (WG), together with Kazu Akiyama (MIT) and Katherine Bouman (CalTech). The EHT Imaging WG comprises more than 100 researchers worldwide and is responsible for producing all the images obtained by the EHT. Dr. Gómez is also the PI of the RadioAstron Key Science Program to study jet formation in AGN jets. Dr. Zhao is one of the two leaders of the SMILI Imaging Team (one of the four Teams within the Imaging WG responsible to produce the EHT images), and one of the two coordinators for the Scattering WG. Dr. Lico is the Secretary of the EHT Management Team, and participates actively in multiple WGs, as well other team members postdocs Ilje Cho and Thalia Traianou, and PhD students Antonio Fuentes and Teresa Toscano. Our research group has already become one of the most relevant in the EHT, and is playing a key role in the analysis of the EHT observations of SgrA*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, for which there are big expectations from the entire scientific community regarding the EHT results to be published soon.
